# DOM `localStorage` performance

An experiment in seeing what is faster - multiple items with JSON contents or a
single item with a JSON array of items with their contents.

See the [**online demo**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/dom-local-storage-perf).

## Results

Using `localStorage` as a KV store is much faster than using it as a single blob
store.

## To-Do

### Describe what the two tests do and present the results in the readme
